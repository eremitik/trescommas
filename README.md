This is a simple package to `re-billionize` any figure.

Stick your current balance in.
```
// I only have $300 to my name :(
// But I want to be like Russ so bad. 
```

Trescommas will work it's magic.
```
import Trescommas from 'trescommas';
const iwannabeabillionaire = Trescommas(300);
```

Who's scared of inflation now?
```
$300,000,000,000
```
