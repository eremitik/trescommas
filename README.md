This is a simple package to `re-billionize` any figure.💰

Stick your current balance in.💔
```
// I only have $1 to my name :(
// But I want to be like Russ so bad. 
```

Trescommas will work it's magic.✨💸
```
import Trescommas from 'trescommas';
const iwannabeabillionaire = Trescommas(1);
```

Who's scared of inflation now?💪🤑
